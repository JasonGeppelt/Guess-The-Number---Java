# Overview

In this project, I've developed a number guessing game in Java to explore and demonstrate my understanding of the language's core concepts and syntax. The software prompts users to select a difficulty level and guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. This project serves as a means for me to enhance my Java programming skills and showcase my proficiency in creating interactive console-based applications.

My primary goal in creating this software was to deepen my understanding of Java's fundamentals, including user input handling, conditional statements, loops, error handling with exceptions, random number generation, and basic game logic implementation. Through this project, I aimed to solidify my grasp of these concepts by applying them in a practical and engaging manner.

# Development Environment

- Tools: I used IntelliJ IDEA as my primary Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing and debugging the Java code.
- Programming Language: Java was the primary language used for this project.
- Libraries: No external libraries were utilized for this simple console-based application.

# Future Work

Aspects to consider for future enhancements and improvements in the project:

- Implement a more interactive graphical user interface (GUI) using JavaFX or Swing to enhance the user experience.
- Incorporate additional gameplay features such as hints or different game modes to increase engagement and difficulty levels.
- Implement a scoreboard or persistent data storage to track high scores across multiple game sessions.
- Refactor the codebase to improve readability and maintainability by breaking down functionality into smaller, more modular components.
